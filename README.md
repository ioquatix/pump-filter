# Pump Filter

This repository contains a part which can be used as a filter on a pump. The pump I have is a "Commercial Electric" PDW-750 Dirty Water Submersible Pump.

## Motivation

Once a year I empty my pond and I'm often concerned about fish getting sucked through the pump. In the past, unfortunately, it's happened, even when using a bucket, wire mesh and various other makeshift filters. Finally, I decided to 3D print a filter bracket that could fit directly in the pump.

## Instructions

1. Print 3x the parts as required.
2. They pressure fit into the pumps inlets around the bottom.
3. When using the pump, ensure the filters don't get blocked completely otherwise the pump will overheat.
